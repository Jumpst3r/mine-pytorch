*slimmed down fork of the orginal MIE repo, updated to work with python3.9, removed non essential modules, functions experiments etc.*

For more information, refer to the original repo:

https://github.com/gtegner/mine-pytorch

and the appropriate paper:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04062.pdf


The goal of this fork is to provide a usable version of the MIE implementation, compatible with recent python / torch versions and stripped of any auxilliary packages, modules and functions which the authors needed for their experiments.

Requires python 3.9

`pip install -e .`
